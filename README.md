# OpenConstitution

The Open Constitution does NOT constitute a declaration of independence, nor does it imply the existence or authority of any governing body or state nor the direct intention to create one.

The purpose of the Open Constitution is to provide a template upon which a real constitution might be based, founded upon the principles of classical liberalism and employing the knowledge gained from both history and theory available to us in modern times.

Its aim is to specify a system of government that is resistant to the corruptions of fascism and socialism, which encourages diversity and competition in politics, which minimizes excesses of government power and the abuse of that power over the long term, which distributes responsibilities in such a way that no action from any branch of government is left unchecked, and which faithfully represents the will and interests of the citizens while providing for the greatest degree of personal freedoms possible in the context of civil order.

For the purpose of making it easy to edit specific parts of the document independently it shall be split into separate files here, each representing a specific section of the constitution, however if it is to be used in a real constitution it should obviously be consolidated into a single document. For the purposes of clarity this repository shall be split into "theory" and "source", where theory contains background information regarding the motivations for how the constitution is written and source contains the actual constitution writ. Please use the issues tab for discussions and for presenting theoretical arguments. All documents should be in rich text format (.rtf) for portability.
